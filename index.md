# Demodalizer

## How do I use Demodalizer?

<div id="installation">Put the contents of this file into the URL of a bookmark: [Demodalizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpennypacker/demodalizer/master/output/bookmarklet-demodalizer.min.js).</div>

When presented with a modal, hit the bookmark and make the modals go away.

## What is a modal window?

A modal, or modal window, is an element of a webpage that seeks your attention by disrupting your browsing activity.  Typically, it's a prompt that asks you for something, and usually it requires that you dismiss it before proceeding to the page's content.  It's like a popup window that's harder to close.

## What does Demodalizer do?

It looks for HTML that matches particular patterns that tend to be unique to modal windows, and it hides them.  It also re-enables scrolling on pages that restrict that.

## Why did you make Demodalizer?

Because modals suck. Think of this as a modern twist on your conventional popup blocker.

## Who is Demodalizer for?

Anyone who hates popups â€” more specifically, anyone who hates modals.
