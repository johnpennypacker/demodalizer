# Demodalizer

## How do I use Demodalizer?

Put the contents of this file into the URL of a bookmark: [Demodalizer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnpennypacker/demodalizer/master/output/bookmarklet-demodalizer.min.js)
When presented with a modal, hit the bookmark and make the modals go away.

## What does it do?

It looks for HTML that matches particular patterns that tend to be unique to modal windows, and it hides them.  It also re-enables scrolling on pages that restrict that.

## Why did you make this?

Because modals suck. They're just like popup windows that are harder to close.  Think of this as a modern twist on your conventional popup blocker.

## Who is this for?

Anyone who hates popups.
